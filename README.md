In this code I build and simulate a wireless communication system on matlab. Any communication system is formed of three main components: a transmitter, a channel and a receiver. The information source sends the message signal via the transmitter and the signal is conducted to a receiver via a channel where it can be overlapped with noise. The signal is received and fed to the user of information. The transmitter is mainly a cascade of a source encoder, a channel encoder and a modulator while the receiver is a cascade of a demodulator, a channel decoder and a source decoder. The purpose of this project is to simulate the basic components of an analog communication system using MATLAB programming. An AM modulator and a corresponding receiver are simulated. There are two different transmission schemes: Frequency division multiple access and quadrature amplitude modulation. In this project the second scheme is simulated. 


Also with the code files you will find a detailed report (.docx file so you can edit it) with all codes details and scientific idea used in building it.
